\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

The ``reproducibility crisis'' in science affects microbiology as much
as any other area of inquiry, and microbiologists have long struggled to
make their research reproducible. We need to respect that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{science and microbiology, in particular, are difficult. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ensuring that
our methods and results are sufficiently transparent is difficult. This

a previous result and even }\DIFaddend if a result is reproducible, it may not be
correct. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This Perspective lays out }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore, failure to reproduce previous results have much to

generalizability of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a particular result. It then describes the
factors that can threaten this framework and approaches microbiologists
can take to overcome the threats. Finally, it provides several exercises

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

On first blush, one might argue that any scientist should be able to
reproduce another scientist's research with no friction. Yet two
anecdotes suffice to describe why this is not the case. The first goes
to the roots of microbiology when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek submitted a
letter to the Royal Society in 1677, ``Concerning little animals'' (1).
This seminal work and several of his prior investigations described
novel observations of microorganisms, but the scientific community
rejected his observations for several reasons. First, because
Leeuwenhoek had little interest in sharing his methods with others, they
could not be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{replicated}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reproduced}\DIFaddend . Second, he wrote in ``low Dutch'' and his
writing was translated to English and edited to half their original
length. This likely removed a significant amount of information
regarding his methods. After several failures, Robert Hooke refined his
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{own }\DIFaddend compound microscope and was able to reproduce Leeuwenhoek's
observations. The precision of Hooke's observations was hindered by his
use of a compound microscope, which had inferior optics to that of
Leeuwenhoek's single lens microscope. In the process, Hooke popularized
the compound microscope. This succession of events is illustrative of
many of the current problems microbiologists face in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reproducing and
replicating }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{validating }\DIFaddend each
other's work. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Of course, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Time has proven that }\DIFaddend Leeuwenhoek's work was rigorous,
impactful, and robust. It was not sloppy and there was no fraud. But, it
required multiple efforts by one of the greatest minds in science to
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{replicate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reproduce the results }\DIFaddend and even then it was a poor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{replication }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reproduction }\DIFaddend of the
original.

The second anecdote took place more recently. In 2011 Philip Bourne
challenged those attending the \emph{Beyond the PDF} workshop
(https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/) to reproduce the analysis
performed in his group's 2010 study \emph{The} Mycobacterium
tuberculosis \emph{Drugome and Its Polypharmacological Implications}
(2). The response to that challenge resulted in a collaborative analysis
involving the original authors and scientists from Spain, China, and the
United States that challenged concepts critical to understanding
reproducible research (3). The reanalysis demonstrated that the value of
reproducibility, the degree to which research should be reproducible,
the amount of effort required to reproduce the research, and who should
be able to reproduce the research are questions without simple answers.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Few would suggest that }\DIFdelend Bourne's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{group was sloppy or that they failed to
be transparent}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{track record in science and as a leader in the field of
bioinformatics suggest that his group was not sloppy and his challenge
indicated a level of transparency that is rare in science}\DIFaddend . Yet the
investigators who sought to reproduce the findings found that someone
with basic bioinformatics skills would require at least 160 hours to
decipher the approaches used in the original analysis and an additional
120 hours to implement them to complete the reproduction.

Both of these anecdotes are at odds with the tone of a recent report by
the American Academy for Microbiology's (AAM's) 2015 colloquium,
``Promoting Responsible Scientific Research'' and its accompanying
editorial in \emph{mBio} (4, 5). The report is a useful lens into how
microbiologists view the reliability of research in their field. The
colloquium identified ``(i) sloppy science, (ii) selection and
experimental bias, and (iii) misconduct'' as the primary contributors to
the ongoing problems with insuring the reliability of microbiology
research. Although the participants were quick to point out that
misconduct was a relatively minor contributor to the problem, the four
case studies that accompanied the original report all concern
misconduct. Missing from these reports was any of the nuance or humility
enveloped in Leeuwenhoek's case or Bourne's challenge: insuring that
one's research design and methods are sufficiently clear is enormously
difficult. Researchers are frequently frustrated \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with their own lack of
documentation }\DIFaddend when they are contacted about a forgotten detail years
after a paper is published. Put simply, most problems with
reproducibility \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and replicability }\DIFdelend are not due to sloppy science, bias, or misconduct. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{I
contend that many of the difficulties we face in ensuring the
reproducibility of our research is social and driven by cultural forces
within science.
}\DIFaddend 

Although the issues identified by the AAM colloquium participants are
important, this Perspective argues that they are not the main reason for
a reproducibility crisis in microbiology. It is scientifically valuable
to consider what other factors threaten our ability to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{validate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reproduce }\DIFaddend a
result. Although these factors highlight the technical limitations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and
cultural forces }\DIFaddend we face, our inability to validate a result may also
indicate that we still have much to learn about biology. Furthermore, we
must remember that whether we can validate a result is not just a
product of rigorous scientific practice, but also a product of
stochastic forces (6\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, 7}\DIFaddend ). We must also be on guard against assuming that
just because a result is reproducible that it is correct (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{7}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{8}\DIFaddend ). With these
general points in mind, the goals of this Perspective are three-fold.
First, I present a framework for thinking about how science is conducted
within the microbial sciences. Second, I provide an overview of various
factors that threaten the field's ability to validate prior results and
the tools that we can use to overcome these problems. Third, based on
these issues, I provide five exercises that research groups can use to
motivate important discussions of their practices and how \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their
practices }\DIFaddend foster or impede efforts to validate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the researchers' }\DIFaddend results.
Although I will primarily focus on examples from microbiome research,
the principles are generalizable to other areas of microbiology \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as all
scientists struggle to ensure the reproducibility of their research}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Threats to
reproducibility}\label{threats-to-reproducibility}

\textbf{Developing a framework.} One of the struggles in discussing
reproducibility, replicability, and the factors that can limit them, is
agreeing upon how they should be defined \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(7). Reproducibility is used as
a vague term for being able to repeat another researchers' work whether
that is with the same protocols or the same populations}\DIFaddend . \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The AAM report used the term reproducibility where others would use replicability. }\DIFdelend This
Perspective will use \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the most widely used definitions, which describe
reproducibility as the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{definitions that have greater precision and that
are based on definitions that are widely used in the statistics
literature. Reproducibility is the }\DIFaddend ability to regenerate a result with
the same dataset and data analysis workflow and replicability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend the
ability to produce a consistent result with an independent experiment
asking the same scientific question (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{7}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{8}\DIFaddend ). I propose a similar framework
that accounts for the practice of applying multiple methods to the same
samples to improve the robustness and generalizability of a result
(Table 1) (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{9}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{10}\DIFaddend ). It is critical for scientists to give attention to the
right hand column of the framework. Most research is exploratory and
scientists, editors, and funding agencies generally lack the will or
ability to confirm previous studies via independent replications or
attempts to generalize results in other model systems or human
populations (4, 5, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7, 11}\DIFaddend ). Results must be reproducible and robust, but
they \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{must also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also need to }\DIFaddend be replicable and generalizable.

\textbf{An example.} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The question of whether there are microbiome-based
signatures of obesity is a useful illustration to demonstrate the
factors that affect each of the quadrants of the grid in Table 1 and it
can be used to underscore the difficulty of ensuring the
reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and generalizability of
results. }\DIFaddend Several research groups, including mine (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{11}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{12}\DIFaddend ), have attempted to
validate the result that obese individuals were more likely to have
lower bacterial diversity and relative abundances of
\emph{Bacteroidetes} (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{12, }\DIFdelend 13\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, 14}\DIFaddend ). The original observation was published in
2008 using 16S rRNA gene sequence data and continues to engender much
enthusiasm for the role of the microbiome in human health (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{14). Although
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15). It is
important to note that }\DIFaddend the original study was \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one of the first to use
high throughput amplicon sequencing and so there was minimal
infrastructure to deposit and store such sequences in public databases.
Furthermore, many of the software tools that we now rely on for
facilitating reproducible workflows were not available. Regardless,
although the original study was }\DIFaddend performed using poorly described data
curation methods, we were able to independently obtain the same results
as the original study when using the same dataset. The original result
can thus be considered reproducible (Table 1). However, when we used the
same methods with data from nine other cohorts, we \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and others have
}\DIFaddend failed to replicate the result (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{11--13}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{12--14}\DIFaddend ). These failures to replicate the
original result may be due to methodological differences across the
replicating studies, differences in study populations, or statistical
variation. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our study demonstrated that each of ten cohorts were
significantly underpowered to identify a 10\% difference in Shannon
diversity (12). Therefore, the lack of statistical power may have been
responsible for an inability to detect a difference. Each of these
studies were rather large for the time that they were published within
the development of the microbiome research field and so the original
researchers likely thought they had obtained the best statistical power
that was feasible. Identifying what a biologically meaningful difference
in any parameter within the microbiome literature to complete a
meaningful power analysis has been a challenge. Each of these factors
still make it nearly impossible to perform a meaningful }\emph{\DIFadd{a priori}}
\DIFadd{power analysis to aid in the design of any cohort. Next, it }\DIFaddend is worth
noting that those involved in the original study pursued multiple
approaches to better understand the question of whether the microbiota
is important in obesity. They initially sought microbiome-based
signatures using mouse models (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{15}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{16}\DIFaddend ). They observed stark differences in
the microbiota of genetically lean and obese mice and that the
microbiota of obese mice could transmit the propensity to gain weight to
germ free mice (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{15}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{16}\DIFaddend ). In a human cohort, they generated multiple datasets
that each reflected different regions of the 16S rRNA gene. In obese
individuals, they observed lower diversity and relative abundance of
\emph{Bacteroidetes} (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{14}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15}\DIFaddend ). They also used shotgun metagenomic sequencing
to postulate the enrichment of carbohydrate processing genes in obese
individuals (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{14}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15}\DIFaddend ). In a smaller cohort study, although the subjects'
diversity remained constant, as the authors predicted, the relative
abundance of \emph{Bacteroidetes} increased as the subjects lost weight
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{17}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{18}\DIFaddend ). Although each part of their approach had significant weaknesses
including methodological biases and underpowered experimental designs,
their results supported the hypothesis that there are microbial
signatures associated with obesity. This conclusion was robust within
the cohort they studied, but it was not generalizable to other cohorts.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Within this example it is apparent that scientists acted in good faith
given the technological and cultural conditions that they were working
in. These conditions underscore the difficulty of replicating and
generalizing results.
}\DIFaddend 

\textbf{Reproducibility.} Threats to reproducibility are some of the
most fundamental and easiest to lay fault on the original investigators.
If a result cannot be reproduced, then it is difficult to have
confidence that it can be replicated or generalized. Thus the ability to
reproduce a result is critical.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Because many journals impose word limits on manuscripts, Materials and
Methods sections become a chain of citations to previous work that each
cite previous work (10). Improved documentation in supplementary
materials or archives such as protocols.io (https://www.protocols.io)
for lab-based methods or through GitHub (https://github.com) for data
analysis workflows would make it easier for researchers to avoid these
rabbit holes. For data analysis workflows, software such as GNU Make
(https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and the Common Workflow Language
(18) make it possible to track data dependencies and automate a
workflow. For example, we used GNU Make to write a workflow in our
meta-analysis of the obesity data , such that
downloading a copy of the scripts from the project's GitHub repository and writing ``make
write.paper'' in the command line will reproduce our analysis. Workflow
tools make it possible to trace the provenance of a summary statistic
from the manuscript back to the raw data .
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Unfortunately, the raw data behind a result is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Too often the underlying raw sequencing data and associated data that
contextualizes the sequencing data are }\DIFaddend often not accessible\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Clearly,
this }\DIFaddend makes reproducing a prior analysis impossible (19, 20).
Well-established databases for storing a variety of ``omics'' data exist
and other data should be archived in third-party databases such as
FigShare (https://figshare.com) and Dryad (https://datadryad.org).
However, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some }\DIFaddend researchers still fail to post their sequencing data to
public databases or do not provide the necessary metadata with the
sequencing data. As we developed the obesity meta-analysis we were
dependent on the original authors to provide the information for two of
the ten datasets. Furthermore, the data made available from the original
study only provided the subjects' body mass index (BMI) as categories
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{14}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15}\DIFaddend ). We were unable to access the actual heights, weights, and BMIs. We
did not include three large datasets from two studies because their data
were inaccessible due to onerous data sharing agreements (21, 22). Two
other datasets required at least a month of effort to obtain (23, 24).
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{More broadly, Stodden et al. (25) recently showed that although
}\emph{\DIFadd{Science}} \DIFadd{magazine has had clear guidelines requiring authors to
make the data and code for their studies available, only 44\% of the
authors who published papers in 2011 and 2012 were willing to provide
the resources. Lack of access to the data and underlying code for an
analysis clearly limits the ability of others to reproduce and build
upon that analysis.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Rapid }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``Link rot'' - the fact that web or email addresses become deprecated -
is a significant problem for those attempting to access the data and
methods needed to reproduce a result (26). Changes in institutional
affiliation frequently render email addresses invalid. ORCID
(https://orcid.org) has emerged as a technology to solve the email rot
problem and many journals use it to provide a persistent link to an
individual's many scientific identities over their career. The fraction
of manuscripts including web resources continues to grow and yet at
least 70\% of those manuscripts include URLs that are inaccessible (26).
To prevent link rot, services like Zotero (https://www.zotero.org) can
provide a digital object identifier (DOI) that persists even if the link
that it points to changes. Unfortunately, the developer of the web
resources must ensure that the resource remains active. The
inevitability of link rot further emphasizes the importance of using
public and stable servers that are likely to persist.
}

\DIFadd{Related to link rot, rapid }\DIFaddend advances in sequencing technology, data
curation, databases, and statistical techniques present an additional
threat to reproducibility \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{because resources and what are considered best
practices are constantly evolving. This evolution is not always well
documented. }\DIFaddend For example, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Human Microbiome Project used Roche's 454 platform to
sequence the 16S rRNA gene (23). This sequencing platform is no longer
commercially available. Data analysis software and databases are also
rapidly changing. The }\DIFdelend mothur software package has had 40 major
updates since it was originally released in 2009 (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{25}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{27}\DIFaddend ). The RDP {[}(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{26}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{28}\DIFaddend );
http://rdp.cme.msu.edu{]} and SILVA {[}(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{27}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{29}\DIFaddend ); https://www.arb-silva.de{]}
databases that many use as a reference for aligning and classifying 16S
rRNA gene sequences are updated annually and the popular greengenes
database files have not been updated since 2013 {[}(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{28}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{30}\DIFaddend );
http://greengenes.lbl.gov and http://greengenes.secondgenome.com{]}.
With each release, curators expand the number of sequences in the
database and make modifications to their taxonomic outline. For software
and databases, it is critical that authors report version numbers if
there is to be any hope of replicating previous work. Unfortunately, the
reliance on web-based \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{workflows like }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resources and workflows at sites such as }\DIFaddend GenBank
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), greengenes, RDP, and SILVA
preclude analyzing new data with older versions of the sites. The
greengenes website removed their online tools in April 2017,
exemplifying the problem with web-based workflows. Their database files
are now available through the company, Second Genome, but their tools
are not. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Combined with the development of new sequencing platforms and
deprecation of old platforms, these changes in technology, references,
and software underscore the importance of adequately documenting
workflows and enabling users to recreate the conditions that the
original researchers worked within.

(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{31}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{35}\DIFaddend ). Although it is possible to pre-register data analysis plans
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{32--34}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{36--38}\DIFaddend ), these plans are often too stringent for most exploratory
research. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Alternatives include
making research notebooks publicly available using

their analyses. I have yet to observe widespread exploration of the
history of projects' repositories or the adoption of pre-registration of
data analysis plans among microbiome researchers. Although these have
their technical and cultural limitations, they offer greater
transparency to improved reproducibility}\DIFaddend .

\textbf{Replicability.} A number of threats similar to those for
reproducibility could explain why a previous result cannot be
replicated. In addition to those detailed previously, there are threats
related to differences in systems or populations and the ability to
control for those differences.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Problems with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Forgotten in discussions of replication failures by many microbiologists
is that a replication may fail because replication is statistical rather
than deterministic (6). Every experiment has a margin of error and when
the effect size is near that margin of error, it is likely that a
statistically significant result in one replicate will not be
significant in another. Most researchers use a frequentist null model
hypothesis testing approach with which they are willing to accept a Type
I error of 0.05. Stated more colloquially, they are willing to
incorrectly reject a null hypothesis in 5\% of the replicates. Further,
they rarely quantify the risk of falsely accepting a null hypothesis
(i.e.~Type II errors) (39). In some cases, an insufficient sample size
in the replicate study may explain the failure to replicate a study. In
other cases, the original study may have been underpowered, rendering it
susceptible to an inflated risk of Type I errors (40). Solutions to
these problems include pre-registering data analysis plans (36--38),
justifying sample sizes based on power calculations (11, 12, 39), and
using Bayesian frameworks that allow prior knowledge of the system to
influence the interpretation of new results (41, 42). It needs to be
underscored, however, that to measure statistical power and use that
information to inform sample size selections one must know what a
biologically relevant difference is. The microbiome field has yet to
make that determination. Our previous power analysis used varying
differences in Shannon diversity (12). As we indicated, those levels
were picked because they seemed reasonable, not because of a biological
foundation. Furthermore, there was no reason to think that diversity
metrics are the most biologically meaningful parameters to base the
calculations on.
}

\DIFadd{Beyond problems of sample size and statistical power calculations,
problems with }\DIFaddend experimental design are \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend often a threat to
replicability because investigators fail to account for confounding
variables in the original study. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A subsequent study may fail to find the
same result because their design is not impacted by the confounding
variable. }\DIFaddend In sequence-based analyses, threats to replicability are
encountered when samples are not randomized across sequencing runs.
These so-called batch effects have been a problem with a large number of
analytical techniques beyond sequencing (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{37}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{43}\DIFaddend ). One notable example
occurred within the Human Microbiome Project where 150 people were
recruited in Houston, TX and 150 in St.~Louis, MO (23). Researchers at
the Baylor College of Medicine and Washington University performed the
DNA extractions for the two sets of subjects, respectively. Researchers
at the Baylor College of Medicine, the J. Craig Venter Institute, and
the Broad Institute sequenced the DNA from the Houston subjects and
researchers from Washington University sequenced the DNA from the
St.~Louis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{subject}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subjects}\DIFaddend . The subject's city was the variable with the largest
effect size, although all parties used the same standard operating
procedures to sample the subjects and extract and sequence the DNA (23,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{38}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{44}\DIFaddend ). Because the city of origin and the center that did the extractions
were perfectly confounded, it was impossible to quantify the impact of
geographic differences on the microbiome. Instead of being a single
study that intended to address associations between geographical and
microbiome variation, this became two replicate studies that were unable
address the influence that geography has on the microbiome. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is easy
to blame the those that designed the study for this confounding, but it
is important to acknowledge the social conditions that were resolved via
negotiations that may have impacted the design and the need to garner
buy in from different centers.
}\DIFaddend 

In addition to variation between human cohorts, variation between
bacterial and model organism strains can hinder efforts to replicate
results. In microbiome research, it is widely appreciated that the
microbiota of research animals from the same litter and breeding
facility are largely clonal and distinct from other facilities (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{16, 39}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{17, 45}\DIFaddend ).
Mice from two breeding facilities at the same institution may have
completely different microbiota. The best example of this phenomenon is
the presence of segmented filamentous bacteria in mice purchased from
Taconic Farms, but not Jackson Laboratories (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{40, 41}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{46, 47}\DIFaddend ). Thus, the origin
of the mice and not the experimental treatment may explain the roles
ascribed to the microbiota. This is particularly a problem for genetic
models when researchers obtain mutant animals and animals with the wild
type background as their control. In such cases using the offspring of
heterozygous matings is critical (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{42}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{48}\DIFaddend ). Similarly, comparing the
microbiota of obese and lean individuals from a cohort of twins and
their mothers in Missouri (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{14}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15}\DIFaddend ) may have confounding factors that differ
from members of Amish communities (24). In these cases, the problem with
replicability is not due to the quality of the investigator's
experimental practices, but to the differences that may be biological,
demographic, or anthropological. Thus failure to replicate a study
across different strains or cohorts could suggest that other interesting
factors play a role in the phenomenon under study.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Uncertain }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Just as uncertainty over the variation in mouse and human populations
can impact the replicability of results, uncertain }\DIFaddend provenance and purity
of reagents, organisms, and samples \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can }\DIFaddend also threaten replicability.
Perhaps the best-known example is the discovery that HeLa cells
contaminate many other cell lines, especially those in the same
laboratory (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{43, 44}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{49, 50}\DIFaddend ). Similarly, investigators frequently realize that
they are working with bacterial strains that were incorrectly typed or
that have evolved during serial passages from the freezer stock (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{45,
46}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{51,
52}\DIFaddend ). Short of resequencing the cells, experimental controls, limiting
the number of passages from freezer stocks, and periodic phenotyping of
the strains can help to overcome these problems. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the microbiome literature, there is a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, it is part of
our scientific culture that if a colleague sends a strain to another
researcher, the recipient generally trusts that they get the correct
strain. There is also a }\DIFaddend growing awareness that DNA extraction kits can
be contaminated with low levels of bacterial DNA (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{47}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{53}\DIFaddend ). These
contaminants have led to the identification of contaminants as being
important members of the lung and placental microbiota when mock
extractions are not sequenced in parallel (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{48--50). }%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{Forgotten in discussions of replication failures is that a replication

hypothesis in 5\% of the replicates. Further, they rarely quantify the
risk of falsely accepting a null hypothesis (i.e.~Type II errors) (51).
In our analysis of the microbiota associated with human obesity, we
observed that nearly all studies were underpowered to detect 5 or 10\%
differences in diversity (11). In some cases, an insufficient sample
size in the replicate study may explain the failure to replicate a
study. In other cases, the original study may have been underpowered,
rendering it susceptible to an inflated risk of Type I errors (52).
Solutions to these problems include pre-registering data analysis plans
(32--34), justifying sample sizes based on power calculations (10}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{54--56). For each of these
threats to replication}\DIFaddend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{11,
51), and using Bayesian frameworks that allow prior knowledge of the system to influence the interpretation of new results(53, 54)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we would be well served by following the proverb
to ``trust, but verify'' by testing the robustness of the results}\DIFaddend .

\textbf{Robustness.} Every method has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Therefore, it is important to address a research question from multiple
and hopefully orthogonal directions. This strategy combines the
strengths of different methods to overcome their individual weaknesses
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{55}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{57}\DIFaddend ). Evaluating the robustness of a result from a single cohort is
becoming more common as researchers pursue multiple approaches including
16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and
metabolomics (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{56--58}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{58--60}\DIFaddend ). Of course, biases in the underlying cohort
design, sample collection and storage, or the nucleic acid processing
will propagate through the analyses. The way to remedy this is to select
methods that are as independent from each other as possible. For
example, data collected from multiple regions of the 16S rRNA gene would
not be considered truly independent datasets since amplicon sequencing
would have been applied to the same samples. The results would be
marginally more independent if one were to layer shotgun metagenomic
data onto the 16S rRNA gene sequence data because although the same DNA
would be used for sequencing, metagenomics provides information about
the genetic diversity and functional potential of a community rather
than the taxonomic diversity of a community. Metabolomic data would be
even more independent from the DNA-based methods since it requires
completely different sample \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{handling and }\DIFdelend processing steps. Quantitative PCR,
cultivation, and microscopy could be similarly layered on these data.
Ultimately, it is impossible for the results of each set of methods to
be fully independent. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If the underlying design of the study is flawed by
insufficient statistical power or failure to account for confounding
variables, then any attempts to test the robustness of a result will
also be flawed.
}

\textbf{\DIFadd{Generalizability.}} \DIFadd{A motivating goal in science is to have a
result that is generalizable across populations or systems. }\DIFaddend Within a
scientific culture that does not place value on publishing negative
results\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend it is difficult to assess whether scientists' bias to support
their prior results affects the ability to claim that a result is robust
or generalizable. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\textbf{\DIFdel{Generalizability.}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{The gold standard of science is to have a
result that is generalizable across populations. Failing to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Similarly, failing to }\DIFaddend attempt replication studies
hinders the ability of researchers to test the generalizability of most
results. Scientists often fear being ``scooped'' (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{59}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{61}\DIFaddend ). In reality, it is
the second researcher who examines the same question that has the
opportunity to increase the field's confidence that a result is valid
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{60}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{62}\DIFaddend ). Generalizability is an important and broad question. Model
organisms (e.g. \emph{E. coli}) and strains of those organisms
(e.g.~K-12) have taught us a great deal about the biology of those
organisms. However, it is not always trivial to generalize that
knowledge to related species and strains or from \emph{in vitro} to
\emph{in vivo} conditions and on to human subjects (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{61, 62}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{63, 64}\DIFaddend ). Like a
failure to reproduce, replicate, or demonstrate the robustness of a
result, a failure to generalize a result is not a failure of science.
Rather, it is an opportunity to better understand the complex biology of
bacteria and how they interact with their environments.

\subsection{Fostering a culture of greater reproducibility and
replicability}\label{fostering-a-culture-of-greater-reproducibility-and-replicability}

\textbf{Training.} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Throughout my discussion of the threats to
reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and generalizability
failures on the part of scientists to be more transparent, provide
greater documentation, or design better experiments have been balanced
by an appreciation that we work within a scientific culture. This
culture is limited by our ignorance of biology, rapid expansion in
technology, misaligned rewards, and a lack of necessary training. }\DIFaddend A key
observation from the work of Garijo and colleagues (3) was that the
level of detail needed to reproduce an analysis varies depending on the
researcher's level of training. An expert in the field understands the
nuances and standards of the field whereas a novice may not know how to
install the software. This highlights the need for training. Yet, many
microbiology training programs focus on laboratory skills while ignoring
data analysis skills. A number of excellent ``best practices'' documents
have emerged in recent years (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{63--68). I have created the Riffomonas project, which
expounds on the threats to reproducibility and tools that
microbiologists can use to maximize the computational reproducibility of
their analyses (http://www.riffomonas.org). }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{65--70). }\DIFaddend In addition, organizations
including Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry offer workshops to
introduce researchers to the best practices in reproducible research
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{69) . }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{71) (https://carpentries.org). }\DIFaddend Massively open online courses have been
developed that teach scientists best practices for performing
reproducible analyses. The most popular of these is a training program
from faculty at the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab
(http://jhudatascience.org). Just as important as learning the
fundamentals of how to implement reproducible research methods is honing
those skills in one's research. A novice could not reproduce Beethoven's
``Für Elise'' from sheet music without prior experience playing the
piano. Similarly, novices cannot expect to reproduce a result without
learning the methods of their discipline. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{With this analogy in mind, I
have created the Riffomonas project, which expounds on the threats to
reproducibility and tools that microbiome researchers can use to
maximize the computational reproducibility of their analyses
(http://www.riffomonas.org). The Riffomonas materials use
microbiome-related examples to illustrate the importance of
transparency, documentation, automated workflows, version control, and
literate programming to improving the computational reproducibility of
an analysis. The goal is that once scientists have been trained in these
practices they can apply them to their own work and use them to ``riff''
or adapt and build on the work of others.
}\DIFaddend 

\textbf{Exercises.} The following exercises are meant to motivate
conversations within a research group to foster a culture improving
reproducibility and replicability and to underscore the threats outlined
above.

1. Working away from each other, have two or more people to write
instructions on how to fold a paper airplane. Have the participants
trade instructions, separate, and implement the instructions. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{After the
participants come back together ask: }\DIFaddend How closely did the final airplanes
resemble that of the person who developed the instructions? What would
have helped to make the reproductions more faithful? How much did the
author of the instructions assume about the other person's prior
knowledge of paper airplanes, resources, and abilities were assumed?
What challenges would length limitations place on this exercise? How
does this exercise resemble the descriptions in the Materials and
Methods section of papers for standard methods (e.g.~PCR) and for novel
methods (e.g.~bioinformatic workflows)?

2. Imagine a graduate student is really excited about an analysis that
you performed in your most recent paper and would like to replicate the
analysis with their own data. But first, they want to make sure that
they reproduce your results. What steps are likely to cause the student
problems? \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If it is not clear to you what problems they might face, find
}\DIFaddend your favorite figure from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{your favorite paper from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a paper by }\DIFaddend a different research group \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{than
your own}\DIFaddend . Can you reproduce the figure? What is standing in your way?

3. Take a figure from your recent paper and improve the likelihood that
another researcher would be able to reproduce it. Where are the data and
how would the researcher access them? What calculations were performed
to summarize the data? What software was used to generate the figure? Is
that software freely available? What steps would the researcher need to
take to generate the figure? When you write your methods, what
experience level are you writing for? Who should you be writing for?
When you are confident that you have made the figure as reproducible as
you can, give the instructions to several colleagues and ask for their
feedback.

4. Complete an audit of the reproducibility practices in your research
group. Table 2 provides a rubric that someone working within the
host-associated microbiome field might use to assess their research.
Within your research group, modify this rubric to suit your needs. For
your next paper, work to improve one element from the rubric and
constantly be developing an ethic of fostering greater reproducibility.

5. Many of the threats to reproducibility and replicability are a
product of scientific culture: methods sections are terse or vague,
original data are not available, analyses rely on expensive and
proprietary software, analysis scripts are available ``upon request from
the authors'', papers are published behind pay-walls. Some might give
into despair thinking that one person or research group can only have a
minor impact. Have a discussion within your group about why things are
this way, whether your group's practices should change, and what would
be the easiest and most impactful thing to change.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

A motivating concept \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that has been attributed to many people to }\DIFaddend improve
the reproducibility of one's research is that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they should think of
themselves from a month ago as their }\DIFaddend most important collaborator\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is themselves six months ago, and
old them does not have email access. Their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. They
are not available to answer questions to things that they have forgotten
in the intervening period. This is a common occurrence for many
researchers who put projects to the side for a time to prepare for
examinations, go on vacations, or work on other projects. Trying to
piece together what they did previously is often a frustrating process.
If instead they had been using tools to improve reproducibility, then
they will be doing themselves a favor when they return to the project.
Similarly, I consider their supervisor or co-authors to be their }\DIFaddend second
most important \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{collaborator is the director of their research group.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{collaborators. It is likely that the corresponding author
was not the person that implemented the details of the analysis plan.
Thus, it is important that they have access and the ability to navigate
the project when they receive a query about how the analysis was done.
}\DIFaddend Anyone that has done research can attest to how difficult it can be to
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{satisfying their
two most important }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{satisfy these two sets of }\DIFaddend ``collaborators''. And yet, if can satisfy
these collaborators, then we should be able to satisfy the third
collaborator, the reader who hopes to build upon our work to generalize
it or go in a new direction.

It is important to see that attempts to guard against threats to
reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and generalizability are
positive forces that will improve science. They have been considered a
form of scientific ``preventative medicine'' (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{7}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{8}\DIFaddend ). Although guarding
against these threats is not a guarantee that the correct conclusion
will be reached, the likelihood that the result is correct will be
increased. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Beyond ensuring ``correctness'' the goal of these efforts,
and I would argue their primary goal, should be to enable future
scientists to build upon the work to go further. }\DIFaddend Before attributing
difficulties with reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and
generalizability to a dim view of our fellow scientists as being sloppy,
biased, or untrustworthy, it is worth seriously considering the many
factors - biological, statistical, and sociological - that pose a
threat. Although there is much room for improvement, we must acknowledge
that science is a process of learning and that it is really f\#\$\%ing
hard.
